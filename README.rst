This tutorial will teach you to manage a project, publish it on PyPI and
create a scikit-learn compliant estimator. The project structure part of
this guide is majorly influenced by the following `tutorial

Structuring a repository
------------------------
An integral part of having reusable code is having a sensible repository
structure. That is, which files do we have and how do we organise them.
Unfortunately, figuring out how to structure a Python project best is not
a trivial task. In this part of the tutorial, I hope to show you a way
to initate any Python project to ensure that you won't have to do major
effort restructuring the code once you want to publish it.
